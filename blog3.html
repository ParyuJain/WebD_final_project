His works, encompassing tragedies, comedies, histories, and sonnets, have continued to captivate audiences for over four centuries. Even today, Shakespeare’s themes of love, power, ambition, and human nature resonate with readers and audiences alike.</p>
    
            <h2>1. <strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong> (Tragedy)</h2>

            <h2>3. <strong>Macbeth</strong> (Tragedy)</h2>

            <h2>6. <strong>The Tempest</strong> (Romance)</h2>

            <h2>8. <strong>Twelfth Night</strong> (Comedy)</h2>
            <p>This delightful comedy is known for its witty dialogue, cross-dressing, mistaken identities, and exploration of love’s many facets. Viola, disguised as a man, falls in love with Duke Orsino, while he is in love with Lady Olivia, who, in turn, falls for Viola’s male persona. The themes of love, gender, and identity continue to resonate today.</p>

His exploration of universal themes—such as love, betrayal, ambition, and the human struggle with fate—continues to resonate with modern audiences.</p>
    
            <p>His characters are fully realized, often embodying contradictory traits, making them relatable and complex. Shakespeare’s ability to probe human nature and tackle deep philosophical questions is what makes his works timeless.</p>
